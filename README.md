# Conditional

Allows restricting which apps are given access to WiFi and Cellular data. This is apparently a feature made only available to some iPhone models in China. Once installed, open the Settings app and navigate to the “Cellular“ section, you‘ll notice now that you can pick and choose which apps can connect to internet at all. A couple years ago there was a tweak named “Conditional WiFi“ that sounded like it achieved the same result. 

Feel free to build from source, or if you'd rather just install the package, you can either download the pre-built deb found in the "packages" folder of this repo, or download this straight from [packix](https://repo.packix.com/package/daniel.conditional/)
